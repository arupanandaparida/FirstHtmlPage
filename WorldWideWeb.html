    <p>Vannevar Bush writes<a href="">an article </a>in <a href="">Atlantic Monthly</a>.about a photo-electrical-mechanical device called a Memex, for memory extension, which could make and follow links between documents on microfiche</p>

     Doug Engelbart prototypes an "oNLine System" (NLS) which does hypertext browsing editing, email, and so on. He invents the mouse for this purpose. See the <a href=" ">Bootstrap Institute library</a><br><br>

Ted Nelson coins the word Hypertext in <i>A File Structure for the Complex, the Changing, and the Indeterminate</i>. 20th National Conference, New York, <a href=" ">Association for Computing Machinery</a> 1965. See also: Literary Machines. Note: There used to be a link here to "Hypertext and Hypermedia: A Selected Bibliography" by Terence Harpold, but the site hosting the resource did not maintain the link.<br>
<br>

Andy van Dam and others build the Hypertext Editing System and FRESS in 1967.
<p><h2>1980</h2>While consulting for CERN June-December of 1980, Tim Berners-Lee writes a notebook program, "Enquire-Within-Upon-Everything", which allows links to be made between arbitrary nodes. Each node had a title, a type, and a list of bidirectional typed links. "ENQUIRE" ran on Norsk Data machines under SINTRAN-III. See: <a href=" ">Enquire user manual as scanned images or as HTML page(alt)</a>.</p>

<dt>May</dt>
<dd>Same proposal recirculated</dd>
<dt>September</dt>
<dd>Mike Sendall, Tim's boss, Oks the purchase of a NeXT cube, and allows Tim to go ahead and write a global hypertext system.</dd>
<dt>October</dt>
<dd>Tim starts work on a hypertext GUI browser+editor using the NeXTStep development environment. He makes up "WorldWideWeb" as a name for the program. (<a href="">See the first browser </a>screenshot) "World Wide Web" as a name for the project (over Information Mesh, Mine of Information, and Information Mine).
    Project <a href="">original proposal</a> reformulated with encouragement from CN and ECP divisional management. Robert <a href="">Cailliau</a> (ECP) joins and is co-author of <a href="">new version</a></dd>
<dt>November</dt>
<dd>Initial <a href="">WorldWideWeb program</a> development continues on the NeXT (<a href="">TBL</a>) . This was a "what you see is what you get" (wysiwyg) browser/editor with direct inline creation of links. The first web server was nxoc01.cern.ch, later called info.cern.ch, and the first web page http://nxoc01.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html Unfortunately CERN no longer supports the historical site. Note from this era too, the <a href="">least recently modified web page</a> we know of, last changed Tue, 13 Nov 1990 15:17:00 GMT (though the URI changed.)</dd>
<dt>November</dt>
<dd>Technical Student Nicola <a href="">Pellow</a> (CN) joins and starts work on the line-mode browser. Bernd <a href="">Pollermann</a> (CN) helps get interface to CERNVM "FIND" index running. TBL gives a <a href="">colloquium</a> on hypertext in general.</dd>
<dt>Christmas
</dt>
<dd>Line mode browser and <a href="">WorldWideWeb</a> browser/editor demonstrable. Acces is possible to hypertext files, CERNVM "FIND", and Internet news articles.</dd>
